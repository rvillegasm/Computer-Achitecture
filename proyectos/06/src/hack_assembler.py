""" 
Main module of the Assembler for the Hack platform.

It uses the Parser, Code and SymbolTable classes to read a Hack assembly language source file (.asm)
and generate an executable file (.hack)

It works in three steps:
  * An INITIALIZATION phase, in which the symbol table is generated, as well as the ROM and RAM counters foe symbols.
  * A FIRST PASS in which it reads the file and adds all the lables to the symbol table.
  * A SECOND PASS in which it goes through the source file line by line and translates every command
    to a 16 bit binary value, adding to the symbol table every unknown variable that it encounters.
